# Deadlock Handling System - User Guide

## Overview
This interactive system helps you learn and understand deadlock handling concepts in operating systems through simulations and gamification.

## Features

### 1. Simulation Mode
- **Banker's Algorithm**: Test deadlock avoidance with safe state checking
- **Wait-for Graph**: Detect deadlock cycles in resource allocation
- **Resource Matrix Input**: Customize allocation, max need, and available resources
- **Step-by-step Execution**: Watch algorithms run in real-time
- **Visual Process States**: See safe, unsafe, and deadlocked processes

### 2. Game Mode
- **Resource Manager Role**: Play as the system resource manager
- **Real-time Requests**: Handle incoming resource requests from processes
- **Decision Making**: Grant or deny requests to avoid deadlock
- **Scoring System**: Earn points for good decisions, lose points for deadlocks
- **Recovery Options**: Handle deadlock situations when they occur

### 3. Dashboard
- **Strategy Comparison**: Compare efficiency of different approaches
- **Visual Charts**: Bar charts and pie charts showing performance metrics
- **Pros/Cons Analysis**: Detailed comparison of each strategy
- **Simulation History**: Track your previous simulation results

## How to Use

### Running Simulations
1. Navigate to the Simulation page
2. Choose your algorithm (Banker's, Detection, Recovery)
3. Modify the resource matrices as needed:
   - **Allocation Matrix**: Current resource allocation per process
   - **Max Need Matrix**: Maximum resources each process may need
   - **Available Resources**: Currently available resources in the system
4. Click "Run Simulation" to see results
5. Enable "Step-by-step execution" for detailed algorithm walkthrough

### Playing the Game
1. Go to Game Mode
2. Click "Start Game"
3. When resource requests appear:
   - Read the request details carefully
   - Check available resources
   - Decide to Grant or Deny within the time limit
4. Monitor your score and lives
5. Handle deadlock recovery when needed

### Understanding Results
- **Green processes**: Safe to execute
- **Red processes**: Part of deadlock cycle
- **Orange processes**: Waiting for resources
- **Safe Sequence**: Order of process execution that avoids deadlock

## Tips for Success

### Simulation Tips
- Start with small examples to understand concepts
- Try different resource configurations
- Compare results across different algorithms
- Use step-by-step mode for learning

### Game Tips
- Don't always grant requests - sometimes denial is safer
- Monitor resource availability closely
- Quick decisions earn bonus points
- Learn from deadlock situations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Backend not starting**: Ensure Python and pip are installed
2. **Frontend not loading**: Check if Node.js and npm are installed
3. **API errors**: Verify backend is running on port 5000
4. **Slow performance**: Close other applications to free up resources

### Error Messages
- **"Request exceeds maximum need"**: Process requesting more than declared maximum
- **"Insufficient resources"**: Not enough resources available to grant request
- **"Unsafe state"**: Granting request would lead to potential deadlock

## Educational Value

### Learning Objectives
- Understand different deadlock handling strategies
- Learn when to use avoidance vs detection vs prevention
- Practice resource allocation decision making
- Visualize complex operating system concepts

### Concepts Covered
- **Deadlock Conditions**: Mutual exclusion, hold and wait, no preemption, circular wait
- **Banker's Algorithm**: Safe state calculation and resource request handling
- **Wait-for Graphs**: Cycle detection in resource dependency graphs
- **Recovery Methods**: Process termination and resource preemption strategies

## Advanced Features

### Custom Scenarios
- Create your own test cases with specific resource configurations
- Export simulation results for analysis
- Compare different approaches on the same scenario

### Reporting
- Generate PDF reports of simulation results
- Export data for further analysis
- Track learning progress over time
